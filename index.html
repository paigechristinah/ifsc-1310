  Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement 
  <p>From my understanding, progressive enhancement is web development tailoried specifically to content and user experience. It's not as focused on enhancing newer browser models as it is on enhancing the content itself that is presented on all browsers. Progressive enhancement's main focus and end goal is to enhance the detail of content on all browsers in order to offer, at the least, a basic user experience to everyone. Although it may take more time and effort than graceful degradation, progressive enhancement is important because it allows for an inclusive experience for all users of the web despite the browser they use. For example, some older people may not be as tech savvy, so they may not always be up to date with the newest technology updates. So it wouldn't be fair for them to get less than a basic web user experience just because they don't know how to update their browser, or they may not know that there is a newer version of their browser at all. So, progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because it promotes justice and fairness to everyone by giving all users across the web a similar experience.</p>
