 <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement </h2> 
  <p>From my understanding, progressive enhancement is web development tailored specifically to content and user experience. It's not as focused on enhancing newer browser models as it is on enhancing content itself that is presented on all browsers. Progressive enhancement's primary focus and end goal is to enhance the detail of content on all browsers to offer, at the least, a basic user experience to everyone. Although it may take more time and effort than graceful degradation, progressive enhancement is vital because it allows for an inclusive experience for all users-of-the-web despite the browser they use. For example, some older people may not be as tech-savvy, so they may not always be up to date with the newest technology updates. So it wouldn't be fair for them to get less than a basic web user experience just because they don't know how to update their browser, or they may not know that there is a newer version of their browser at all. So, progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because it promotes justice and fairness to everyone by giving all users across the web a similar experience.</p>

 <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2> 
I thoroughly enjoyed this class more than I expected to originally. It was a nonstop challenge for me considering that I am completely new to coding so I can definitely agree when people say coding is like learning a new language. One of the projects I feel that I did well on this semester was my first css-demo project. I love the way my web page turned out, I love the color theme, and overall I think it looked very professional and user-friendly. I also think I did an incredible job recreating the star web icon, especially considering that due to my poor planning, I recreated it in only one day. I feel that I did well at keeping my folders and files in Gitpod organized even though it was very confusing and rocky at first, I eventually got the hang of it and got confident and comfortable with linking my Html files, CSS stylesheets, and javascript files to the right locations. </p><p>What I would do differently, if I were to start over would be first, I would try to adjust my work schedule to fit around this class better so that way I could actually attend some of the lectures in person and not watch all of them online. I think that would've helped me not get so behind on coursework and have more time to devote to my assignments thus producing better work. I would also practice more during my free time on the areas I found especially challenging, such as padding, margins, positioning, and creating slide shows. Lastly, I would have asked my teacher and his assistant a lot more questions throughout the semester!</p><p>I received a lot of positive feedback on my website, everyone said they liked the color theme and that it looked professional. Most of the critiques I got were very minor. Some of them were that I needed to be more consistent with my color scheme, so the "submit" button on my contact form page was green and they said I should change it to fit the color scheme theme more so I implemented that change by making the button blue. My friends and family also suggested that I make those three pictures on the home page into a slideshow, but I struggled tremendously in this area and couldn't get my slideshow to either present or interact with the user the way I wanted to no matter how many different times I tried. So I decided to just combine them into a slideshow display, but left the interactive portion off of it. I centered the FAQ heading after someone pointed out to me how it looked odd off to the side in the first version. And then I wanted to implement the italic and strong tags on the contact form page to make the words at the top stand out more. </p> <p>All in all, although far from perfect, I am proud of how my website came out. I definitely could always make adjustments to it to continue to improve it, but due to the time restraint, I won't be able to make it perfect. But I'm very proud that I challenged myself and didn't give up even though the frustration and late nights. And I am so thankful for the wonderful teacher I had all semester who never gave up on me and continued to be patient with me. Thank you for this wonderful learning opportunity!</p>
